Welcome to the Stock Application! ðŸ“ˆ

This is a Dash application that allows users to input a stock by a ticker value and a date range to display four charts: Candlestick chart, trading volume, daily returns, and drawdowns.
The user has the option to choose between showing the charts for all years of the date range or the charts for a specific year. There is NO analysis for this project. This is solely an app 
that can displays the charts. 

The program consists of two files that interact with each other: "stock.py" and "stock_api.py". Below is the data flow diagram that shows how the two files interact with each other:
